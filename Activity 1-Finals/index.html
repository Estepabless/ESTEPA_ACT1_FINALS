            <h1>Topic 1</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Art is a wide range of human activities (or the products thereof) that involve creative imagination
                 and an aim to express technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.
                 <br></br>
                 In the perspective of the history of art, artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: 
                 from early pre-historic art to contemporary art; however, some theorists feel that the typical concept 
                 of "artistic works" fits less well outside modern Western societies. One early sense of the definition of art 
                 is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft", as associated 
                 with words such as "artisan". English words derived from this meaning include artifact, artificial, artifice, 
                 medical arts, and military arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation 
                 to its etymology.
                 </p>
            <h2>Topic 2</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Visual arts are art forms such as painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, ceramics, photography, video, filmmaking, 
                design, crafts and architecture. Many artistic disciplines such as performing arts, conceptual art, and textile arts 
                also involve aspects of visual arts as well as arts of other types. Also included within the visual arts are the applied 
                arts such as industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, interior design and decorative art.
                <br></br>
                Current usage of the term "visual arts" includes fine art as well as the applied or decorative arts and crafts, 
                but this was not always the case. Before the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain and elsewhere at the turn of the 20th century, 
                the term 'artist' had for some centuries often been restricted to a person working in the fine arts (such as painting, sculpture, 
                or printmaking) and not the decorative arts, craft, or applied Visual arts media. The distinction was emphasized by artists of the 
                Arts and Crafts Movement, who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms.
                </p>
            <h3>Topic 3</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Fine art is "a visual art considered to have been created primarily for aesthetic and intellectual purposes and judged for its 
                beauty and meaningfulness, specifically, painting, sculpture, drawing, watercolor, graphics, and architecture." In that sense, 
                there are conceptual differences between the fine arts and the decorative arts or applied arts (these two terms covering largely 
                the same media). As far as the consumer of the art was concerned, the perception of aesthetic qualities required a refined judgment 
                usually referred to as having good taste, which differentiated fine art from popular art and entertainment.
            <br></br>
            The word "fine" does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional 
            Western European canons. Except in the case of architecture, where a practical utility was accepted, this definition originally excluded 
            the "useful" applied or decorative arts, and the products of what were regarded as crafts.
            The term is typically only used for Western art from the Renaissance onwards, although similar genre distinctions can apply to the art of 
            other cultures, especially those of East Asia. The set of "fine arts" are sometimes also called the "major arts", with "minor arts" equating 
            to the decorative arts. This would typically be for medieval and ancient art.</p>
